Monolithic and micro services 

1) In monolithic services all are combined and maintained in one server then it is Called monolithic

2) Micro services are nothic but each resourse will be run on single server it is called micro service

ex : 

3) In paytm application we have many services movie tickets , Train tickets , bank services ,payment details Thesr are combilned in one server it is called monolithic 

4) The above services are run in different servers then it is called micro service

5) In monolithic data is in clumsy and if one service got an error and the other services should be stopped

6) In micro services if 1 service got an error it will not imapact on other services

7) Instead of using monolithic services we should use micro services.

8) In micro services Time consumption and cost is very high when we compared to monolithic so inorder to overcome this we are using the docker.

9) By using Docker tool , we are creating multiple containers on single server 

Components of Docker 

1) Container : It is vm it doesnot require os

2) Virtulization : There is one physical computer we are using the resources and making one computer, It is used to create vm 

3) Hypervisor : help to make virtualization

4) Containerization : Process of packing applications along with its dependencies is called containerization 

5) Docker : It is a tool create containers

Docker : 
Docker is the tool which is used to automate the deployment application in a light weight container, so that the application can work efficiently in different environments 

>> It is written on Go Language

>> It is used to run application on host os

>> It is release on march 2013  and developed by "solomon hykes" & "sebastian pahl"


Components of docker 

1) Docker client and server : 

2) Docker images

3) Docker container

4) Docker Registry
