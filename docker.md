Monolithic and micro services 

1) In monolithic services all are combined and maintained in one server then it is xalled monolithic

2) Micro services are nothic but each resourse will be run on single server it is called micro service

ex : 

3) In paytm application we have many services movie tickets , Train tickets , bank services ,payment details Thesr are combilned in one server it is called monolithic 

4) The above services are run in different servers then it is called micro service

5) In monolithic data is in clumsy and if one service got an error and the other services should be stopped

6) In micro services if 1 service got an error it will not imapact on other services

7) Instead of using monolithic services we should use micro services.
